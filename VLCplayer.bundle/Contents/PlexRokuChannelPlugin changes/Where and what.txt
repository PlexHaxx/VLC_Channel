What:
in -> PreferenceScreen.brs

Replace the file.
All changes are tagged with: ' WTW
added a new Function:
-> posterActivate(screen)


Purpose:
This change works, but is not perfect for general channel usage.  It does not seem to interfere with the other channels I tried.  But I didn't try many.
When returning to a screen in a channel from a message screen (not the back arrow), the change reloads the screen to reflect changes to that screen made by the channel running in PMS.
The VLC Channel does this so that the user can see changes to the VLC player state.
ex:
Play VLC -> VLC Playing
Pause VLC -> VLC Paused
Stop VLC -> VLc Stopped
The Video clip object icon will only appear if VLC is playing. (You cannot view a stream that does not exist. You are viewing the output stream of VLC.).
It will not appear otherwise.
