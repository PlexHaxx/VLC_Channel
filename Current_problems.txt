I use VLC to transcode and stream back out an internet stream feed from a direct video file URL, like:
http://cs514220v4.vk.me/u5723140/videos/88479e1a6c.360.mp4   (which no longer exists)

VLC output parameters:

:sout=#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=800,acodec=mpga,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:http{mux=ts,dst=:11223/} :sout-all :sout-keep



When I use the URL service using VideoClipObject() and the URL of "http://127.0.0.1:11223" (the VLC stream out) it works.
If I try to change everything for the URL of "http://127.0.0.1:11223/stream.ts" it no longer works.
What am I doing wrong???
**** This is now fixed. Regex error was corrected.



When I don't use the URL service: see the commented line: vco = CreateVideoClipObject(url_vlc, Dict["Today"]) # date only
It does not work.  I don't really understand if this is set up correctly either.
What am I doing wrong???

*** Changed to that it at least gets to the JW Player.  It then throws an error:
    el = obj._to_xml()
  File "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\Framework.bundle\Contents\Resources\Versions\2\Python\Framework\api\objectkit.py", line 496, in _to_xml
    raise Framework.exceptions.AttributeException('If no URL is provided, the key and rating_key attributes must be set.')
AttributeException: If no URL is provided, the key and rating_key attributes must be set.



In ValidatePrefs(); the: return ObjectContainer(header="Error", message="That is not a valid IP port.")
does not result in a popup on the user interaface informing the user of the error.
How do you generate such an error message popup?
*** This is partially fixed.  It displays the error message, but when the pref is corrected, it will display the message again sometimes; like the first time it is corrected and when you return to the MainMenu.
It is like the object is still attached to the main menu.
