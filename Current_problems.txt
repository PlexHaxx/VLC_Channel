3/3/2014:
Fixed some issues with preferences.  Additional cleanup. Sill trying to speed up the start of playback.
Still requires the PMS bug fix (provided) and is easier to use with the Roku Plex Channel mod (which may be beyond some users' ability or desire).


3/1/2014:
Minor adjustments.  However, a bug fix to PMS (included in a folder) is required.  Also, a change to the Roku Plex channel plugin (also included in a folder) is beneficial, though not required.
It is working pretty much how I want it to work.  There is still a slow stream retrieval process that is probably due to an automatic transcoding issue that needs to be resolved.


Major cleanup.  Works the same; no new features.  Removed the library imports that PMS already provides through the framework. (2/27/2014)
Includes a very minor code mod to one file in PMS due to a coding error.  See the PMS bug fix folder.
Roku does not update the Screen, even if PMS has new data for that screen.  Still looking into how to
accomplish this without having to exit and re-enter the Channel.

Working more reliably than ever.  UI is in pretty good shape.  Seems to play nice with Roku.  (2/23/2014)

Currently, the coding errors seem to be well under control.  Need further Roku usage testing. (2/18/2014)


I use VLC to transcode and stream back out an internet stream feed from a direct video file URL, like:
http://cs514220v4.vk.me/u5723140/videos/88479e1a6c.360.mp4   (this link no longer exists)

VLC output parameters:

:sout=#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=800,acodec=mpga,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:http{mux=ts,dst=:11223/} :sout-all :sout-keep



When I use the URL service using VideoClipObject() and the URL of "http://127.0.0.1:11223" (the VLC stream out) it works.
If I try to change everything for the URL of "http://127.0.0.1:11223/stream.ts" it no longer works.
**** This is now fixed. Regex error was corrected.



When I don't use the URL service (i.e. manual method): see the commented line: vco = CreateVideoClipObject(url_vlc, Dict["Today"]) # date only
It does not work.  I don't really understand if this is set up correctly either.
**** This is now working.  The user, in the settings/prefs, can choose to use either the URL Service, or use the manual method.



In ValidatePrefs(); the: return ObjectContainer(header="Error", message="That is not a valid IP port.")
does not result in a popup on the user interaface informing the user of the error.
How do you generate such an error message popup?
????? This is partially fixed.  It displays the error message, but when the pref is corrected, it will display the message again sometimes; like the first time after it is corrected and whenever you return to the MainMenu.
It is like the message object is still attached to the main menu and active.
**** This is fixed.  Had to set header='' and message='' in the ObjectContainer when created in MainMenu.



Added the ability to launch (and exit) VLC from the channel.  VLC can be launched either inside or outside the channel plugin.  The channel plugin will detect it and can use it, or close it.
**** This seems to be working.  However, the path information is set for my system.  See the top of the __init__ file.
This sometimes never leaves the app start method StartApp() for some reason.
**** Fixed.  Forgot to set the process handle to null on stop.



The code for configuring VLC when started outside the plugin is not complete.  I'm not sure it can be done without restarting VLC.
**** Have to restart VLC.  Cannot change the launch configuration parameters using the web interface. This is not a fix, it is just the way it is.



Added the ability to play, pause, and stop the VLC player from the channel plugin.  This is done through the VLC web interface.
The URLs work fine in a browser.
Problem: Right now it never gets to the callback method for the click event.
**** Fixed and working.



Added the ability to change the stream file for VLC to stream in settings.  Haven't worked on URLs yet.
**** Seems to be working well.



Added a choice for transcoding or no transcoding.



I now know that VLC will provide meta data for the stream.  This is not yet implemented. This may only be applicable for no transcoding, since the meta data appears to be for the source stream, not transcoded stream.
**** Partially implemented.
**** Resolved: Implemented as much as I could without using URL sources.  Done.



When using the URL Service, when viewing the stream and you backarrrow one level and then Play again, and select resolution, it then becomes a download.  It only goes back to playing the stream if you back out another level.
????? I have no idea why this happens.
***** The Youtube and Khan Plex channels have this issue also.  It appears to be a problem in PMS.
***** Resolved: This is a Plex/Web or Plex Media Manager issue.  It does not occur on Roku.
