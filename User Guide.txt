Setting in the code specific to the developer: (except for "fq_file" (see below), I believe that the channel should work without code modifications)

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\URL Services\VLCplayer\ServiceCode.pys
The IP addresses and port numbers ->
DEFAULT_URL   = 'http://127.0.0.1:11223'

VLC_VIDEO_DETAILS = 'http://:ok@127.0.0.1:5555/requests/status.json'


C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\Code\__init__.py
Nothing found

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\DefaultPrefs.json
check all default values,
especially for ->
fq_file
fq_url
