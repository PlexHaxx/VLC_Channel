Settings in the code that are specific to the developer: (except for "fq_file" (see below), I believe that the channel should work without code modifications)

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\URL Services\VLCplayer\ServiceCode.pys
The IP addresses and port numbers ->
DEFAULT_URL   = 'http://127.0.0.1:11223'

VLC_VIDEO_DETAILS = 'http://:ok@127.0.0.1:5555/requests/status.json'


C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\Code\__init__.py
Nothing found

C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\VLCplayer.bundle\Contents\DefaultPrefs.json
check all default values,
especially for ->
fq_file
fq_url



SETTINGS:

Delayed Start - standard delays the video start 5 seconds after the player is invoked by Plex.
                none allows you to actually start the video and then attach on the fly.
Use URL Service checkbox - if checked the channel uses the Plex URL service system, otherwise everything is configured explicitly.
Transcode the stream?  yes/no - if yes the stream is transcoded (see the __init__.py file, VLC_ARGS1)
VLC stream transcoding string(s) - only one currently configured, easily changed in DefaultPrefs.json
VLC stream mux String(s) - the first is all I am testing with now, easily changed in DefaultPrefs.json
VLC Host IP: The IP address for the VLC output stream and the web interface. This is checked using a regular expression pattern
VLC Host Port for stream - (what it says) This is checked using a regular expression pattern
VLC Host {/Path/}Page -> space for none - the VLC path/page reference set for the output stream. This is checked using a regular expression pattern
VLC Host Port for control - used for the web interface. This is checked using a regular expression pattern
VLC Lua Password - used to access the web interface.  (Since it is set to this at launch and used for access it can be anything)
Fully Qualified filename - full path name (ex. C:/...) This is checked using a regular expression pattern
Fully Qualified URL - full URL (ex. http://...) This is checked using a regular expression pattern
VLC Source (used raw) - the full URI required by VLC to access a streamable or stream source. This is NOT checked using a regular expression pattern



Main Menu: (all controls provide feedback messages for clarity)

Play VLC Stream - this launches the Plex video player to view the VLC output stream.
Play List - opens another directory level for Playlist control
Play VLC - [For Delayed Start = none] Starts VLC playing the currently selected item and confirms that play started.
           [For Delayed Start = satndard] Starts and immediately pauses VLC.  This allows VLC to finalize the connection while Plex is not waiting to avoid a timeout. The pending/ready status can be checked, but not too quickly since VLC does not update it fast enough.  I'm working on this. (Use: Play/Pause/Refresh to check)
Pause VLC - Pause VLC playing (toggle) 
Stop VLC - Stop VLC playing
Launch VLC - This starts up the VLC application and syncs the playlists automatically
{or}
Restart VLC - This closes the detected VLC application (not started with Launch VLC) and then starts another instance with this Channel's parameter settings and syncs the playlists automatically
{or}
Exit VLC - This closes the VLC application started by: Launch VLC
Status VLC - not currenty used
Refresh - refreshes this directory




Playlist Menu: (The currently selected item does not have a folder icon)
A list of current VLC play items appears first
...
SYNC -> VLC Playlist - synchronizes teh Playlist in this Channel with the one on VLC
CLEAR -> VLC Playlist - deletes all items in the playlist in the VLC application
ADD -> Plex Playlist to VLC - This only adds what is in this Channel's playlist that is not in VLC's
REPLACE -> Plex Playlist with VLC - Replaces (does not merge) this Channel's playlist with the VLC playlist

Selecting a playlist item generates another menu:
SELECT ->  - selects the identified item for playing (it does not leave it playing)
DELETE ->  - deletes the identified item
